## Introduction
Heyo! Thanks for checking out my personal project GhibliVerse, as of 1-27-2024 GhibliVerse is still in developement and will slowly but surely become available for public use! In the meantime, here are some of the core features I intend to create for this application:
* Information of all Studio Ghibli films
* A comprehensive analysis of Studio Ghibli characters
* Fun and interactive quizzes on Studio Ghibli film knowledge

## Project Technologies
### Frontend
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
  - React.js

### Backend
- Python
  - Flask
- Database
  - SQLite

## Purpose
I've always wanted to create a fun personal project that I could personally use and reference in my own daily life, that being said a fun fact about myself is that I love Studio Ghibli films whole heartedly and growing up they were films I would watch endlessly. I own almost every single film in Blu-Ray and even have a tattoo sleeve of all of my favorite ghibli characters. This fullstack application presents a fun challenge as I will try to implement new features I haven't created before and for it be about content I personally enjoy shall make this process very exciting.
